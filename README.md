# Backpropagation from scratch

In this notebook I created a simple neural network that uses backpropagation to improve it's predictive capability. The purpose of this was to give a clearer insight into the mathematics behind neural networks and how each step is performed.

It can be easy to make use of neural networks in Python through libraries like Tensorflow without actually thinking about how the network is formed and how the model is improved. It gives the user a high-level look at how NNâ€™s can be applied but I wanted to understand the actual process of improving predictions through training. For that I decided to code a model from scratch, just using Pandas and Numpy. All the formulae that is used has been created in individual functions with most of them employing simple mathematical equations.
